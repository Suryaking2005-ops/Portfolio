      "*   **Data-Driven Analysis:** I process and synthesize information from a vast dataset of architectural knowledge, historical precedents, and contemporary trends. This allows me to identify patterns, understand principles, and offer solutions based on established best practices and emerging concepts.\n",
      "*   **Objective Optimization:** I can analyze design problems by considering various parameters, such as structural integrity, material efficiency, energy performance, user comfort, and regulatory compliance. My goal is to identify solutions that optimize these factors based on the information provided.\n",
      "*   **Adherence to Principles:** I can articulate and apply fundamental architectural principles like form follows function, proportion, scale, rhythm, and harmony. I understand how these principles are applied in different architectural styles and contexts.\n",
      "*   **Adaptability and Responsiveness:** I can adapt my responses based on the specific requirements and constraints of a given project or query. Whether the focus is on sustainability, historical accuracy, minimalist aesthetics, or high-tech innovation, I can draw upon relevant information to provide tailored insights.\n",
