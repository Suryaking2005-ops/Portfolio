You've just seen the core concept of agent development in action.\n\nThe big takeaway is that your agent didn't just *respond*—it **reasoned** that it needed more information and then **acted** by using a tool. This ability to take action is the foundation of all agent-based AI.\n\n**ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n\nThis notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only. You **do not** need to submit it anywhere to complete the course.\n\n### 📚 Learn More\n\nRefer to the following documentation to learn more:\n\n- [ADK Documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)\n- [ADK Quickstart for Python](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/get-started/python/)\n- [ADK Agents Overview](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/)\n- [ADK Tools Overview](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/tools/)\n\n### 🎯 Next Steps\n\nReady for the next challenge?
